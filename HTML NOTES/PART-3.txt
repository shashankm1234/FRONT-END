(1)HTML EXTRA NOTES 
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading.
The <p> element defines a paragraph.

(2)An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>

(3)Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit:
Step 1: Open Notepad (PC)
Step 2: Write Some HTML
Step 3: Save the HTML Page
Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").

HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag. The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML images 
Defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.

(4)View HTML Source Code:
Right-click in an HTML page and select "View Page Source" (in Chrome) or "View Source" (in Edge), or similar in other browsers. 
This will open a window containing the HTML source code of the page.

Inspect an HTML Element:
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to see what elements are made up of 
(you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.


(5)Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.

(6)There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. 
In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg".
If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

(7)The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
Example   <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

(8)The HTML <pre> Element
Defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.

(9)HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text        (The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted)
<small> - Smaller text      (The HTML <small> element defines smaller text)
<del> - Deleted text        (The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text)
<ins> - Inserted text       (The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text)

<sub> - Subscript text      
(Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:
Example
<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p> )

<sup> - Superscript text
(Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:
Example
<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>)

(10)HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
Example
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.
</blockquote>

HTML <q> for Short Quotations
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
Example   <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>

(11) Hide Inline Content
Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.
Hide a part of a paragaph:    <p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>

(12) HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Relative URLs
A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part).

(13) HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:
<a href="default.asp"> <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">  </a>

Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

Create a Bookmark in HTML
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.
To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.
First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:  <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>

(14) The HTML <picture> Element
The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.
The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. 
This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.
Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture>

(15) TABLES
Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.  Each table row starts with a <tr> and end with a </tr> tag.
Sometimes you want your cells to be headers, in those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag.

(16)HTML Description Lists
HTML also supports description lists.
A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:
<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>

(17)The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

(18) HTML Iframes
An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page. The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.
An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
Syntax:  <iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe> 
         <iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

(19) File Path Examples
Path	Description:
<img src="picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page
<img src="images/picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder
<img src="/images/picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
<img src="../picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder


(20) RESPONSIVENESS:
To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.

Using the width Property
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down.

(21) HTML Entities
Some characters are reserved in HTML.  If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
A character entity looks like this:
&entity_name;
OR
&#entity_number;
To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;

(22) The HTML <video> Element   
How it Works
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.

To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element:
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

HTML <video> Autoplay
To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute:
<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


(23) The HTML <audio> Element
To play an audio file in HTML, use the <audio> element:
<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

HTML <audio> Autoplay
To start an audio file automatically, use the autoplay attribute:
<audio controls autoplay>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
To play your video on a web page, do the following:

Upload the video to YouTube.
Take a note of the video id.
Define an <iframe> element in your web page.
Let the src attribute point to the video URL.
Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player.
Add any other parameters to the URL (see below) :
Example
<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY">
</iframe>
