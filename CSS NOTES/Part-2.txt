[3] CSS SELECTORS:
In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.
Eg: There are 2 images and you want to modify only 1 instead of both,we'll use SELECTORS.

So here we'll use CLASS SELECTORS.

Class attribute class="" helps us to differentiate in all of our HTML Elements.

FOR CLASS IN CSS, WE USE A DOT (.) IN FRONT OF ITS NAME.

CODE:
IN HTML    
<img class="myImage1" src="images/Image 1-modified.png">
<img class="myImage2" src="images/Image 2-modified.png">

IN CSS 
.myImage1{
background-color : green;
}

.myImage2{
background-color : blue;
}


[4] CLASS SELECTORS VS ID SELECTORS:
Id and class both are the CSS element selectors and are used to identify an element based on its assigned name. 
CSS id and class selectors are the most used selectors in CSS.
During the use of selectors, sometimes there is confusion occurs between id and class. Both of them do not have any default styling information; 
they require CSS to select them and apply it to style.
Although both are used for selecting the element, they are different from each other in many ways.

Class:
-> We can apply a class to various elements so that it could be numerous times on a single page.    (IMP)
-> The class is assigned to an element and its name starts with "." followed by the name of the class.
-> We can attach multiple class selectors to an element. (IMP)

SYNTAX:
.class{
// declarations of CSS
}
Eg: <h1 class="heading">I AM A CODER!</h1>
In CSS: 
.heading{
background-color : red;
}

ID : 
-> The Id is unique in a page, and we can only apply it to one specific element.  (IMP)
-> The name of the Id starts with the "#" symbol followed by a unique id name.
-> We can attach only one ID selector to an element.     (IMP)
-> The id selector is used to select the id attribute of an HTML element for selecting a particular element. 
-> An id is always unique within the page, so it is chosen to select a single, unique element.
It is written with the hash character (#), followed by the id of the element.

SYNTAX :
#id{
// declarations of CSS
}
Eg:  <h1 id="heading">I AM A CODER!</h1>
In CSS: 
#heading{
background-color : red;
}

NOTE: USE CLASSES WHEN YOU WANT TO APPLY SAME STYLE TO A GROUP OF RELATED ITEMS.
      USE ID TO APPLY A SPECIFIC STYLE TO A SINGLE ELEMENT ON YOUR WEBPAGE.

Eg:  Name is a CLASS as many people can have same name.
     Aadhaar Number is an ID as each one has unique.


[5] IMAGE HOVER: When our cursor goes on the image, it changes its background-colour.

Syntax:

img:hover{
background-color : blue;
}

When our cursor will go at that image, its background-color will become blue.
