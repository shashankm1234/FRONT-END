CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

What is CSS?
-> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
-> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
-> CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

CSS Example :
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}

CSS Solved a Big Problem :
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. 
Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page.

TYPES OF CSS :
1. INLINE CSS
2. INTERNAL CSS
3. EXTERNAL CSS


SYNTAX TO CHANGE BACKGROUND OF OUR BODY:
<body style="background-color: blue;">

(1) INLINE CSS:
The Inline CSS uses the style attribute to apply CSS to a single HTML element.
EXAMPLE:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1 style="color:crimson;font-family:cursive;">Hello World!!</h1>
</body>
</html>

Disadvantages of Inline CSS:
-> The inline CSS cannot be reused anywhere else.
-> The inline CSS can not be stored at a single place and so the styles are tough to be edited.
-> Styling of the pseudo-codes and pseudo-classes is not possible with inline CSS.



(2) INTERNAL CSS:
The internal style sheet is used to add a unique style for a single document. It is defined in <head> section of the HTML page inside the <style> tag.
EXAMPLE:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
body {  
    background-color: linen;  
}  
h1 {  
    color: red;  
    margin-left: 80px;  
}   
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h1>The internal style sheet is applied on this heading.</h1>  
<p>This paragraph will not be affected.</p>  
</body>  
</html>  

First specify the name of element you want to change like body OR p (paragraph) OR h1 anything.

<head>
        <style>
        body{
            background-color: blue;
        }
        </style>
</head>

First we have the element i.e. body,then inside the braces we have what we want to changw i.e. background-color and at last we have the value i.e. blue.

CODE FOR INTERNAL CSS:
<style>
        body{
            background-color: #EAF6F6;
        }

        hr{
            background-color: white;
            border-style: none;
            height: 2px;
            /* width: 100px;     OR */  
            width: 30%;
        }

        /* img{
            height: 20px;
        } */
</style>


BORDER STYLE:   The border-style property sets the style of an element's four borders. This property can have from one to four values.
Examples:

(a) border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
-> top border is dotted
-> right border is solid
-> bottom border is double
-> left border is dashed

(b) border-style: dotted solid double;
-> top border is dotted
-> right and left borders are solid
-> bottom border is double

(c) border-style: dotted solid;
-> top and bottom borders are dotted
-> right and left borders are solid

(d) border-style: dotted;
-> all four borders are dotted


Default value:	none
Inherited:	no

CODE FOR INTERNAL CSS:
<!-- For getting the boilerplate code: html:5 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>SHASHANK'S PERSONAL SITE</title>

    <style>
        body{
            background-color: #EAF6F6;
        }

        hr{
            /* background-color: white; */
            /* border-style: dotted none none;   */
            border-style: none;
            border-top-style: dotted;
            border-color: grey;
            border-width: 5px;
            /* width: 100px; OR width = 30% so that when site gets opened in any device,width will be according to it, 30% in that device*/  
            width: 5%;
        }

        /* img{
            height: 20px;
        } */

    </style>

</head>



[3] EXTERNAL CSS:
Using CSS in a separate file and linking it with the html file.
Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
</head>

Inside href, css means the FOLDER and styles.css means the file address.

Just add this link to any of your page and see it working as an EXTERNAL CSS.
<head>
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
</head>


(a) CSS TEXT COLOR:
Text Color
The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:
-> a color name - like "red"
-> a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
-> an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"

Ex:
body {
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  color: green;
}


(b) Text Color and Background Color
In this example, we define both the background-color property and the color property:

Example
body {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

div {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
